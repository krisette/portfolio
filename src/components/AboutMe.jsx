          <p className="text-white mb-5">Hi! I'm Krisette Odegard and I'm based in Los Angeles, CA. When I was a kid on the Internet, I liked making "pet pages" for my Neopets. Over time, this evolved to deploying personal blogs in high school with their own domain. In 2016, I graduated from nursing school and began a career in health care as a Registered Nurse. Life has a funny way of changing things up, and I decided to revisit my childhood passion. Now I'm a full-stack software engineer that specializes in JavaScript/React/Node.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-5">In my spare time, I like playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, and trying new restaurants. I also love Disney theme parks; it's my goal to go to every single Disney park in the world. (If you're wondering, I'm currently 3/7: I've been to Disneyland, Disney World, and Tokyo Disney so far.)</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-5">Here are some of the technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
